\section*{\textcolor{RoyalOrange}{Projects}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{\href{https://github.com/Ramsai170899/Claim_number_Estimation_Pyspark}{Actuarial Data Science Project using Pyspark}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item An Actuarial Data Science initiative focusing on estimating the number of claims in motor insurance. Utilized Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for regression analysis on count data. Evaluated models including Negative Binomial (NB2), Poisson, Quasi-Poisson, and Neural Networks using Crash Analysis System (CAS) dataset. The Negative Binomial regression model demonstrated superior performance with an RMSE of 0.30 and an MAE of 0.09, outperforming other models while consuming significantly less modeling time compared to the Neural Network approach.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{\href{https://github.com/Ramsai170899/LetsGrowMore-DS_Internship-powerBI/tree/main}{Global Terrorism KPI Dashboard using powerBI}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Created interactive PowerBI dashboards using SQL queries to explore and visualize global terrorism data. Integrated Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for insightful visualizations. Achieved high accuracy in identifying hotspots and trends using precision, recall, and other KPIs.
        \end{itemize}
