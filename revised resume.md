## Work Experience

**Actuarial Business Analyst** | CreditAccess Life Insurance | Feb 2024 – Present

*   Built a scalable **Python-based data validation framework** to process and cleanse high-volume policyholder and claims data, ensuring data integrity for analytics and regulatory reporting.
*   Developed and optimized an end-to-end **Reserve Calculation model**, achieving a **7x performance improvement** by refactoring code and improving algorithms, which reduced runtime from 3.5 hours to 30 minutes.
*   Created an internal **RAG-based chatbot** using a custom knowledge base, allowing employees to quickly find information on products and regulations.
*   Designed a framework to **automate IRDAI Actuarial Annual Returns and Solvency Calculations**, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.
*   Developed interactive **Powerpivot and Power BI dashboards** to analyze claim patterns, product profitability, and portfolio performance, supporting data-driven decision-making.

**Actuarial Data Science Intern** | SSSIHL | Nov 2023 – Jan 2024

*   Led a project to estimate motor insurance claim frequency by building and evaluating **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)** and **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** on a Crash Analysis System (CAS) dataset.
*   **Model Comparison & Selection:** Evaluated Negative Binomial (NB2), Poisson, Quasi-Poisson, and Neural Network models. The **Negative Binomial model performed best (RMSE: 0.30, MAE: 0.09)** and was selected for production due to its high accuracy and lower computational cost.
*   Built an end-to-end **Fraud Detection tool** that identified fraudulent insurance claims with 91% accuracy.

**Software Engineer** | Bluezone International Inc | Sep 2022 – Oct 2023

*   Improved a data collection and fingerprint analysis application by implementing bug fixes, new features, and performance optimizations.
*   Configured and optimized fingerprint matching algorithms and sensor calibration using console-based Autotune and performance evaluation tools.
*   Worked on a fraud detection module that analyzed fingerprint pattern logs to identify suspicious activity and provided user feedback to improve sensor performance.

**Actuarial Data Science Intern** | Tech Actuarial | Jun 2022 – Aug 2022

*   Contributed to a predictive modeling project for **insurance fraud detection**.
*   Addressed severe class imbalance in the dataset by implementing **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**.
*   Trained and evaluated a **Random Forest classifier** that achieved **95% accuracy and an AUC score of 0.99**, effectively identifying fraudulent claims.
