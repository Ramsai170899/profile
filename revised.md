### **Revised Resume Sections**

#### **Objective**

A Professional Summary is more modern and impactful than an Objective. It summarizes your experience and value upfront.

> **Data Scientist & Actuarial Analyst** with expertise in developing and deploying machine learning models and data engineering tools to solve complex business problems in the insurance and financial sectors. Proficient in the end-to-end model lifecycle, from data validation and feature engineering in Python and PySpark to deploying production-ready solutions that drive efficiency and provide actionable insights. Proven ability to deliver significant performance improvements, including a 7x speed-up in critical financial forecasting.

#### **Work Experience**

**Actuarial Business Analyst** | CreditAccess Life Insurance | Feb 2024 – Present

*   Engineered a scalable **Python-based data validation framework** to process and cleanse high-volume policyholder and claims data, ensuring data integrity for downstream analytics and regulatory reporting.
*   Developed and optimized an end-to-end **Reserve Calculation model**, achieving a **7x performance improvement** by refactoring code and algorithm optimization, reducing runtime from 3.5 hours to 30 minutes.
*   Architected and built an internal **RAG-based chatbot** using a custom knowledge base, streamlining employee training on complex product details and insurance regulations.
*   Designed a framework to **automate IRDAI Actuarial Annual Returns and Solvency Calculations**, reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of human error.
*   Developed interactive **Tableau/Power BI dashboards** to analyze claim patterns, product profitability, and portfolio performance, enabling data-driven strategic decisions.

**Actuarial Data Science Intern** | SSSIHL | Nov 2023 – Jan 2024

*   Led a project to estimate motor insurance claim frequency by implementing and evaluating **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)** and **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** on a Crash Analysis System (CAS) dataset.
*   **Model Comparison & Selection:** Evaluated Negative Binomial (NB2), Poisson, Quasi-Poisson, and Neural Network models. The **Negative Binomial model achieved superior performance (RMSE: 0.30, MAE: 0.09)** and was selected for production due to its high accuracy and significantly lower computational cost compared to the neural network.
*   Developed an end-to-end **Fraud Detection tool** with high accuracy (state the % if possible) for identifying fraudulent insurance claims.

**Software Engineer** | Bluezone International Inc | Sep 2022 – Oct 2023

*   Enhanced a data collection and fingerprint analysis application by implementing bug fixes, new features, and performance tuning.
*   Configured and optimized fingerprint matching algorithms and sensor calibration protocols using console-based Autotune and performance evaluation tools.
*   Contributed to a fraud detection module that analyzed fingerprint patterns to identify suspicious activity and provided user feedback for improved sensor performance.

**Actuarial Data Science Intern** | Tech Actuarial | Jun 2022 – Aug 2022

*   Contributed to a predictive modeling project for **insurance fraud detection**.
*   Addressed severe class imbalance in the dataset by implementing **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**.
*   Trained and evaluated a **Random Forest classifier** that achieved **95% accuracy and an AUC score of 0.99**, effectively identifying fraudulent claims.

### **Key Improvements in the Revised Version:**

*   **Stronger Verbs:** "Engineered," "Architected," "Led," "Optimized."
*   **Clearer Impact:** Explains *why* the work was important (e.g., "ensuring data integrity," "reducing manual effort").
*   **Quantification:** Highlights the 7x speed-up and specific model metrics (RMSE, MAE, AUC).
*   **Modern Terminology:** Uses terms like "RAG-based chatbot," "end-to-end model lifecycle," and "production-ready solutions" that resonate with tech companies.
*   **Focus on Transferable Skills:** Your actuarial work is framed as data science, software engineering, and ML Ops work, making it highly relevant for any data-driven company.

This revised version presents you as a results-oriented technologist who can build robust data solutions, not just an analyst who performs tasks. Good luck
